Unity projects:

NotN Water - Industry Project for my fourth semester of HBO, in which we were tasked to expand on an existing minigame compilation project. I created the ShowerTimer minigame.

Spell Ya Later - Duo Project made with Francois Haan for my fourth semester of HBO, where we created a fast-paced platformer together. I worked on Level 2 and 3, and added the Portal Staff powerup.

Zombie Runner - First project made for my fourth semester of HBO, in which we dabbled with Unity through a tutorial project with our own spin added to it. The goal was to add something reminiscent of your favorite game - which in my case was the battle music of Persona 3 added to encounters with the zombies.
